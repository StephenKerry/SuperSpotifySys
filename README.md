# A Introduction to my System 

This  simple system will be created for the users entertainment. It will contain a plethra of functions relating to music that the user will enjoy. I decided to go with a spotify system as Spotify is an app that i use in my daily life and I have a huge interest in all kinds of music..
This is all coded by Kotlin and inspired by the Notes App and Employee App we made in our practical labs. The system has a total of 5 functions/features and an exit function that will shut down the system. The user will navigate through this menu by choosing option 0-5 on the keyboard. 


## App Features 

### Seeing Stephen's top 5 songs:
This feature is accessed by the user by pressing 1. This is just a simple simple feature I am adding to show off the listing function which will just display my (Stephen)'s top 5 favourite songs and will also provide a link to the video on Youtube.  

### Add a song to the system 
This feature is accessed by the user by pressing 2. The user is then prompted to add a song title, the artist who made it, its date of release, the genre of music and finally the stream/view count. This information is then stored in the system

### Search for a song in the system and its stats
